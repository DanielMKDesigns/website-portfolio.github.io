           <p><strong>One of my favorite Logo Designs</strong> One of my favorite Logo Designs I have created is designing the logo for my client - a young dentist located in Cherry district near Cherry beach in Toronto, Canada. She wanted a modern, shiny Logo concept with clearly chosen colors and to be unique and different from other dentists in her city as much as possible. She told me her demands and asked for my suggestions on what the logo should look like and after a long conversation we came up with mutual understanding and agreement. I tried many different logo design concepts with close collaboration with my client and came up with 3 different Logos at the end.</p>
           <p>My client wanted 2 different logos, the first and main one to be applied on her Dental Clinic as a lightning commercial and the secondary logo to be applied on business cards, brochures of services they offer, etc. My client chose the first and second logo design, but I decided to incorporate the third one as well in my portfolio because I think looks nice as well.</p>

           <p><strong>One of my most challenging projects</strong>  was designing a Logo for the Band of young enthusiasts whose dream and desire was to be recognizable in their city. The client wanted the logo to be recognizable, old-school but at the same time modern as well because the members of the band were young musicians. I started to design different logo concepts and I came up with 3 which I was thinking they are most suitable for them.</p>

           <p>I had 3 revisions of the logo and made changes according to the client's desire and taste. In the end, I came up with 3 logos, and surprisingly for me he chose all of them, but he said that the neon variant will be his first choice, and the third version will be his icon.</p>

            <p><strong>The hardest logo project</strong> I was working on in my opinion was designing the logo for Marketing Agency - Versatile Marketing. The client was precise and perfectionist in what he wanted and he wanted something completely new and different from the competition with the main focus on the name and initials in the logo(he wanted the name of his agency to be incorporated in the logo. I conducted market research seeking different concepts, ideas, and the competitors from which I wanted to differentiate.</p>
            <p>For this project, I had 5 revisions because all the concepts did not really match his taste but in the end, after testing so many concepts and so many logos I found the formula to design the perfect logo for his agency, and at my big pleasure my client was very satisfied.</p>

           <p><strong>The most exciting project I was working on
           </strong> was designing a Logo for the Old Timers Auto-Repair shop because I love cars, especially "American muscle" cars so the excitement was very high during the design of this logo. My client wanted the logo for his Auto-Repair shop to be completely Old-School so it matches the business he has and the cars he repairs.</p>
           <p>I developed 3 logo concepts that could possibly match his demands and taste and he picked 2 of them. My suggestion was to incorporate an old-timer car in the logo, not just repair tools as he initially wanted, so the logo could be more dynamic and descriptive and to differentiate from other car-repair shops that repair all kinds of cars but they are not focused primarily on old-timers as my client does.
           We both agreed that this way looks more descriptive and recognizable so he chose both logo concepts to be used simultaneously.</p>
